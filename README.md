Python homework PyBank and PyPoll

In PyBank, I created a script for analyzing the financial records of a company.  There will be an output showing total months incuded in the dataset, total profit/losses and their averages.  It will also show the greatest increase in profits and the greatest decrease.  

In PyPoll, I created a script for analyzing election data.  The final output will show total number of votes cast, complete list of candidates who received votes, percentage of and total number of votes each candidate won and the final winner of the election based on popular vote.
